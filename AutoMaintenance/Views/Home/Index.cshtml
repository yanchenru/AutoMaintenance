        Create a simple object oriented library for tracking automobile maintenance. 
        The system should support at least three car types: electric, gas and diesel. 
        Each vehicle should have at minimum a make, model, year and odometer reading. 
        Maintenance tasks should include 2-3 things like oil changes or tire rotations. 
        However, not all maintenance tasks can be applied to all vehicles (an electric car won’t need an oil change).
    </p>
    <p>
        Your library or API should be capable of listing, adding, updating and removing entries at runtime. 
        Supply unit tests to demonstrate your features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Demonstrate usage using a web interface. You should also demonstrate your knowledge of how javascript can be used to provide functionality in the UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        This problem is evaluated based on the design of your library and how usable it would be to others.
